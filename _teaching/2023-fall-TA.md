This is a course named《深度学习与人工智能》 or *Deep Learning*.
I have wrote a detailed TA manual in [TA_DL_Manual](https://github.com/Helenology/TA_DL_Manual), covering how to split tasks among different TAs.
My TA partners are [
Jamesyu420](https://github.com/Jamesyu420) and [jinlinqishichizhongwu](https://github.com/jinlinqishichizhongwu).
