I am currently documenting interesting topics about how to do academic research in [Research_Toolbox](https://github.com/Helenology/Research_Toolbox) with my cooperators [Shuyuan Wu](https://github.com/shuyuanwu) and [
TheHiddenObserver](https://github.com/TheHiddenObserver). Our goal is to share our tricks to make research a bit more easier.
